            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              Embarking on a PhD journey is far from a straight line. It is a winding, zigzag road filled with challenges, self-discovery, and moments of triumph. For me, this journey has been an exercise in patience, perseverance, and maintaining a delicate balance between personal life, academic goals, and financial constraints.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              I started my PhD at Tokyo Metropolitan University with a fire in my heart—a deep passion for languages, machine learning, and the ambitious goal of decoding the ancient Indus script. This wasn’t just a pursuit of a degree; it was a pursuit of a dream. Along the way, I encountered numerous setbacks, from financial difficulties to juggling part-time jobs, but every obstacle made me stronger and more determined to achieve my goal.
            </p>

            <h2>Overcoming Financial Challenges</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              One of the most difficult decisions I had to make was in April 2024, when IEEE organized a trip to Hokkaido. This event was a golden opportunity for research collaboration, networking, and to be a part of crucial discussions about the future of Hokkaido. My professor had visited Future Hakodate University, and I was eager to join the Hokkaido Future Projects Initiative, which aimed to solve some of the region’s most pressing issues. I had so many plans for the event, including sharing my research ideas and contributing to solutions that could bring about real change.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              However, my financial situation made this impossible. Although the event offered reimbursement later, I didn’t have the means to book my tickets and hotel in advance. My scholarship had just ended, and I was balancing research with part-time work to support myself. The trip was beyond my financial reach, and I had to make the difficult decision to opt out. Missing this event was a significant regret, as opportunities like this are rare. I had so much I wanted to contribute, and it felt like a missed chance to be a part of something important. If I get another opportunity in the future, I will make every effort to attend.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              This experience taught me a valuable lesson in resilience and sacrifice. In life, sometimes you have to let go of certain opportunities to focus on the bigger picture. It’s a tough lesson to learn, but one that has strengthened my resolve moving forward.
            </p>

            <h2>The Balancing Act: Research, Work, and Life</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              As I continued my PhD journey, I found myself constantly juggling multiple responsibilities. My scholarship had ended, and I had to work part-time jobs to make ends meet while still focusing on my research. It was during this time that I learned a valuable piece of advice from Professor Komachi Mamoru, a former NLP professor at Hitotsubashi University: "If you must take a part-time job, make sure it is related to your future career or research." His advice stuck with me, guiding my decisions and ensuring that every job I took contributed to my long-term goals.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              Another professor, Asanobu Kitamoto from the National Institute of Informatics, gave me words of encouragement that carried me through the tough times: "Eventually, you will be there." Simple yet powerful, this reassurance reminded me to keep going, even when the road felt impossibly long.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              My current supervisor, Professor Yasufumi Takama, has been a constant source of support throughout my journey. He always reminds me, "You can do it, even if it’s a small portion." His approach has helped me break down overwhelming tasks into manageable steps, making the journey more bearable.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Mentorship and Support from the Lab</h2>
            
            <p style="text-align: justify;">

              In addition to my professors, I’ve been fortunate to have strong support from others in my lab. Assistant Professor Shibata, for example, has a unique way of keeping me on my toes. He constantly asks questions, challenging me to think critically and analyze the world differently. He often says, "Don’t trust big organizations when they give something for free." His nagging is always in good faith, pushing me to question the status quo and become a more critical thinker. Despite his tough exterior, he’s been incredibly supportive and helpful throughout my journey.
            </p>
            
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              Another key figure in my academic life is Professor Qibin Zhao from the Riken Tensor Learning team. He is not only an expert in his field but also fosters a family-like environment within his team. His trust in his team members and his collaborative spirit have made working under his supervision a rewarding experience. Professor Zhao's innovative ideas and international collaborations have expanded my understanding of global research landscapes, and I feel fortunate to have had the chance to work with him.
            </p>

            <h2>Lessons from Extraordinary Mentors</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              I’ve been fortunate to have some truly inspiring mentors throughout my PhD journey. Professors like Kentaro Inui from the NLP lab at Tohoku University and Riken have taught me the value of patience and long-term vision in research. But no one has been more supportive and encouraging than my supervisor, Professor Takama. He has been more than an academic guide; he has been a mentor, a confidant, and a role model. His understanding and kind nature have made this journey a rewarding one. I often think that perhaps I have been blessed to have such a mentor—someone who pushes me but also gives me the space to grow.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              Many PhD students struggle with demanding supervisors who expect constant publishing, but Professor Takama understands the bigger picture. He knows the importance of graduating on time, especially for international students in Japan, who may face financial difficulties if their research is prolonged. His guidance has struck the perfect balance between encouraging productivity and allowing me to breathe.
            </p>

            <h2>The Value of Extracurriculars and Internships</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              PhD research is about much more than just academic work. Throughout my journey, I’ve been fortunate to participate in various events and projects that broadened my perspective on how research applies to the real world. Visits to research centers like CyberAgent, Bloomberg, Amazon AWS, and Kyocera gave me a first-hand look at different research environments and their ongoing projects. These experiences allowed me to see how academic research could be translated into industry solutions, bridging the gap between theory and practice.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              Internships at Fourth Valley, TMU, and Riken gave me invaluable experience in working professionally, collaborating with colleagues, and managing time effectively. I realized that research alone isn’t enough—you need to be able to communicate your ideas clearly and concisely. My belief is that research should always add value, either to society or to the field itself, even if it is largely theoretical.
            </p>

            <h2>Broader Perspective: Organizing and Learning Beyond Research</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              Organizing and participating in extracurricular events have also been critical to my growth. Competing in the ASEAN Forum, WIE (Women in Engineering) competitions, Microsoft Imagine Cup, and the Google Solution Challenge exposed me to global issues and made me appreciate the need for sustainable solutions. These experiences fueled my desire to conduct research that is not just innovative, but also socially impactful.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              Volunteering at English camps in Japan, working with young children, gave me a deeper understanding of how young minds approach learning. It was a refreshing contrast to the academic environment and reminded me of the joy of discovery that originally sparked my passion for research.
            </p>

            <h2>The Road Ahead: Graduation and Beyond</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              As I approach the end of my PhD journey, with graduation expected next year, I am filled with a sense of accomplishment and excitement for what lies ahead. This journey has been a dream come true, but it has also tested me in ways I never expected. I’ve learned the importance of patience, perseverance, and consistency. Perfection is a long road, one that requires constant effort over time, but I am willing to walk that road.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              My research into the Indus script and historical languages has been particularly rewarding. By creating and evaluating datasets, I hope to contribute not only to my own research but to the wider field. My goal is to pave the way for future researchers, helping them build on my work to unravel the mysteries of the Indus script and its relation to other ancient languages.
            </p>

            <h2>A Final Word of Advice</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              As Professor Takama once said, "You can do it, even if it’s just a small portion." Don’t give up on your dreams—update them, adjust them, but never abandon them. Be stubborn in your pursuit, but also flexible enough to adapt when necessary. Always listen to your heart and your professor; both have your best interests at heart. And if you have personal issues, resolve them within your circle of friends and family—don’t let them affect your work.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              In the end, the only person who can stop you is yourself. No one else has that power. So manage your time wisely, stay consistent, and focus on doing your best. Don’t overthink the results—just concentrate on the work in front of you.
